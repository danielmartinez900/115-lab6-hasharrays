use 'struct' to create an entry that can have different data types, for word/word frequency. entry.word entry.frequency would get the word/frequency relationship.
you also need to define entry. Such as: struct entry { }. create class hasarray that has struct entry and entry arr[hasharaay] defined in it. Also keeps track of update count and cost count.
(part of the assignment). loop through hasharray and insert 0 into every index (in constructor). entry arr[hasharray]<- this is the acutal hasharray. 
hashkey(string str)
{
	creates the index for the input (sum aschii % HASHSIZE)
}
size ()
{
keeps track of the size of hash.
}
update (string str)
{
	//
	q = hashkey(str);
}
probe will be set to 0 in update function, because it keeps track of probe count for every time update is called. Probe value is asscocitated with the word in the hash.

int print function, make the ratio (the divide by 0 part, make sure that there is a condition to check that you are not trying to divide by 0.)
